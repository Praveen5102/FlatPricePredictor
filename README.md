# Flat Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the price of flats in a city using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises area names, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage of flats. Leveraging linear regression, the model predicts flat prices. The backend is developed using Python Flask, providing a robust API for predictions. Additionally, a user-friendly website is created using HTML and CSS to enhance the prediction experience.

## Key Components

- **Dataset:** Includes area names, bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.
- **Model:** Utilizes linear regression for price prediction.
- **Backend:** Developed with Python Flask, serving as the API for predictions.
- **Frontend:** User-friendly website designed using HTML and CSS.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python and Flask are installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Flask server: `python app.py`.
5. Access the website and make predictions.
